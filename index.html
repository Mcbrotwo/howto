   <h4 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>11 c. flour</li>
<li>2 T. yeast</li>
<li>6 T. sugar</li>
<li>6 T. oil</li>

<ol>
<li>Put water in a kettle and turn on to heat up.</li>
<li>Put 4 cups of flour and all other dry ingredients into a very large bowl and stir to combine.</li>
<li>Pour oil and milk into a large glass measuring cup. if you dont have a large enough measuring cup, combine ingredients in a pot </li>
<li>Start adding the 3 cups of hot water. When you only have about a half a cup left, feel the water and keep stiring and feeling the mixed liquids as you add the water if it's too hot, add a little cold water if it's to cold, add more of the hot water it should be hot enough that you feel a reaction to sticking in your finger but not enough that you will want to pull your finger out</li>
<li>Mix the liquids into the flour with a large spoon.</li>
<li>pour remaining flour into the bowl, stiring as you go along. When its to hard add flour to your spoon and scrap it clean. Start kneading</li>
<li>stop adding flour or add more flour to get a consistency where it's no longer sticking to your fingers</li>
<li>knead about ten minutes You can't overknead when you are doing it by hand. you lift the bread onto its end, press down, turn the bowl, and repeat.</li>
<li>stop when it's satiny and it springs back right away when you press down on it.</li>
<li>pour oil around edge of the bowl. Spin the dough around in the oil to cover the dough and the bowl with oil</li>
<li>cover the bowl in plastic wrap and then a towel</li>
<li>if you are in a hurry, put it in a warm place.</li>
<li>after it has doubled in size, punch it down and form it how you'd like to cook it: loaf, bread sticks, rolls, etc.</li>
<li>let it rise another 40 minutes before baking at 400 degree in the oven for 20 minutes.</li>
